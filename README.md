#CommandBlocksJS
CommandBlocksJS executes Javascript code and translates it to Commandblock logic.

##Documentation
moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/M4GV5/CommandBlocksJS/wiki)

**Note** there is a [Quick Start](https://github.com/M4GV5/CommandBlocksJS/wiki/Quick-Start) page for those who cant wait to write their first script

##Examples
The most Basic example is a simple auto-announcer nearly every server has one:
```javascript
timer(1200, //Timer tick in deciseconds
    function() //function to execute every 120 seconds
    {
        //say message
        say("Some message that will annoy everybody after 6 minutes");
    }
);
```
The Output commandblocks look like this:

Of Course you can do much more complex stuff like this:
```javascript
//setup karma scoreboard objective
//name: karma, type: dummy, displayName: Karma
var karma = new Score("karma", "dummy", "Karma");
//set display slot to sidebar
karma.setDisplay("sidebar");

//subscribe to the 'onentitykill' event
EventHandler.setEventListener('onentitykill', function(player)
{
    //tell the player he just earned karma
    tellraw(player.getSelector(), "You just earned one Karma".format(Formatting.red));
    //add 1 karma
    karma.add(player.getSelector(), 1);
});
//subscribe to the 'ondeath' event
EventHandler.setEventListener('ondeath', function(player)
{
    //save selector of the dead player in local variable
    var playerSelector = player.getSelector();

    //setup tellraw command that tells him his karma
    var karmaMessage = new Tellraw();
    //Add Text 'The Player <name> had a Karma of <valua>'
    karmaMessage.addText("The Player ");
    karmaMessage.addSelector(playerSelector);
    karmaMessage.addText(" had a Karma of ");
	karmaMessage.addScore(playerSelector, "karma");
	
	//tell the message to everybody
	karmaMessage.tell("@a");

    //reset karma
    karma.set(playerSelector, 0);
});
```
