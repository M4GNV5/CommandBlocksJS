#CommandBlocksJS
CommandBlocksJS allows you to program commandblocks logic in typescript/javascript. The major benefit in using CommandBlocksJS instead of building the blocks yourself is that you can create complex logic a lot faster that than you could in minecraft. Furthermore you can 'build' stuff like countdown timers in 4 lines of code where you would need ~10 minutes to write all the commands ingame.

##Documentation
**cooming soon**

###Legacy Documentation (<2.0)
[Here](https://github.com/M4GV5/CommandBlocksJS/wiki)
There also is a [Quick Start](https://github.com/M4GV5/CommandBlocksJS/wiki/Quick-Start) page for those who cant wait to write their first script (with version 1.3)

##Examples

```javascript
//
//https://github.com/M4GNV5/CommandBlocksJS/blob/master/Example/CircleCalculations.ts
//

/// <reference path="../Core/API.ts"/>

//start at radius
var startRadius = 1;
//stop at radius
var stopRadius = 20;

var radius = new Runtime.Integer(startRadius);
var timer = new Util.Timer(calculateNext, 1);
timer.start();

function calculateNext()
{
	var circumference = new Runtime.Decimal();
	var area = new Runtime.Decimal();

	var pi = Runtime.Decimal.Pi;

	// C = 2 * pi * r
	circumference.set(radius);
	circumference.multiplicate(pi);
	circumference.multiplicate(2);

	// A = r * r * pi
	area.set(radius);
	area.multiplicate(area);
	area.multiplicate(pi);

	// output current values
	Chat.Tellraw.create(
		"r = ",
		radius.toTellrawExtra(),
		", C = ",
		circumference.toExactTellrawExtra(),
		", A = ",
		area.toExactTellrawExtra()
	).tell(new Entities.Player("@a"));

	//add one to radius
	radius.add(1);

	radius.isBetween(stopRadius, undefined, function ()
	{
		timer.stop();
	});
}
```
